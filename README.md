Build dependencies
------------------

* [obuild](https://github.com/vincenthz/obuild)

Installation
------------
This is intended to be an OPAM package but for now it can be insalled like
this:
```
$ make
$ make install
```

Usage
-----

Simple module which uses `Pci_db` to find PCI device information:

```ocaml
let () =
  let pci_db = Pci_db.of_file Pci_db.pci_ids_path in
  let class_name = Pci_db.get_class_name pci_db 0x03L in
  let vendor_name = Pci_db.get_vendor_name pci_db 0x10deL in
  let device_name = Pci_db.get_device_name pci_db 0x10deL 0x01daL in
  Printf.printf "The %s is a %s and is made by %s.\n"
    device_name class_name vendor_name
```

Compile and run as follows:

```
$ ocamlfind ocamlopt -package unix -package stdext -package pci-db -thread -linkpkg trial.ml -o trial
$ ./trial
The 'G72M [Quadro NVS 110M]' is a 'Display controller' and is made by 'NVIDIA Corporation'.
```

It's also possible to use this library in scripts using the following:

```ocaml
#!/path/to/ocaml

#use "topfind"
#require "pci-db"
```
